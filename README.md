# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Technologies Used
```
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- AJAX
```

## Process
```
  My development process was divided into two steps, where in the first step I started
with brainstorming on how to tackle all the individual parts of this project based on
my user stories. Then I took those individual parts and grouped them together into a
schedule to be tackled each day of the project.

  Step two of the project was where I began to code based of the schedule that I
had created in the first step of my development process. During this process I was
able to adhere to the goals that I had set for myself everyday except for the last,
which involved communicating with the API. This proved to be the most challenging part
of the project for me because I had initially built out all of my game data to exist
locally and I had to do a significant amount of refactoring in order to get it to
play nice with the API. In hindsight if I had to start this project over I would have
began with playing with the data from the API and basing my game logic off of that as
it would have required less work overall and would have left me with more time for
styling the UI at the end.

```

## Unresolved Problems
```
- The UI is a bit lackluster and could use some significant upgrades via Bootstrap.
- I would like to eventually have more detailed game stats for the users instead of just total games played.
- I would also like to add the option of playing against an ai.
- I would like to add multiplayer functionality so two people in different locations can play against one another.

## User Stories
```
- As a user, I want a sign in option so that I can log all of my game data.

- As a user, I want a sign out button so I can log out once I am done playing.

- As a user, I want to be able to start a new game once I have finished a game.

- As a user, I want to be able to select which spot to place 'X'.

- As a user, I want to be able to select which spot to place 'O'.

- As a user, I want to be notified when the game is over and if I won, lost or tied.
